# DiceSeed

Offline, air-gapped dice-roll → BIP39 seed phrase generator for the
[LilyGO T-Display S3](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3) (plain,
non-touch variant).

You physically roll a d6, enter each result on the board's two buttons, and
the firmware turns your rolls into a standard 12- or 24-word BIP39 mnemonic —
the same kind of phrase a hardware wallet shows you, generated from entropy
*you* supplied and can audit, not a hardware RNG you have to trust blindly.

## What DiceSeed is for (and what it isn't)

DiceSeed is a **generator**: it turns entropy you supplied and can audit
into a standard BIP39 phrase. It is not a signer, not a wallet, and not a
place to keep anything.

The intended flow is: run it **on battery power with no USB cable
attached**, roll and enter your dice, write the phrase down, verify it
(the built-in backup check, plus an optional
[cross-check](#cross-checking-your-output)), then load that phrase into a
proper hardware signer for actual custody. Once you've written the phrase
down and wiped the device, DiceSeed has no further role.

It is **not** a substitute for a Coldcard / SeedSigner / Blockstream Jade
when it comes to holding funds:

- The T-Display S3's USB port is a native USB-Serial-JTAG peripheral,
  enabled in silicon, so anyone with a cable and OpenOCD can halt the CPU
  and read RAM while a phrase is on screen (see
  [Security model](#security-model)). A device that stores nothing and
  signs nothing is a smaller target — but only because it does less.
- The ESP32-S3 has WiFi and Bluetooth radios physically present on the
  board. This firmware never initializes either one, and the repo contains
  no radio code at all — but "no radio in the firmware" is not the same as
  "no radio on the board." Someone who needs the latter guarantee wants a
  different device.

If that trade is acceptable — you want to supply and verify your own
entropy by hand, on a cheap device, and move the result into real
custody — that's exactly the job this does.

## Why dice instead of the chip's own RNG?

Because then nothing has to be trusted except a defined, checkable
conversion from your rolls to entropy — no hardware RNG, no radio, ever,
is mixed in (see [Security model](#security-model)). There are two builds
of that conversion, trading two different kinds of trust against each
other — see [Build variants](#build-variants).

## Hardware

- LilyGO T-Display S3 — **either the plain or the Touch version**. Uses the
  board's ST7789 display (170×320, 8-bit parallel bus) and its two built-in
  buttons (GPIO0, GPIO14).
- **Which button is which?** On a non-Touch board, every button-driven
  screen carries small `1`/`2` markers plus an edge tick at the far right
  of the display, aligned with the physical buttons on the board edge
  (BTN1 = GPIO0 near the top-right, BTN2 = GPIO14 near the bottom-right) —
  so the "BTN1: … BTN2: …" hint lines map to the hardware in your hand
  without guessing. Touch boards don't draw these (their flows are
  tap-driven).
- **One firmware serves both boards.** On boot it probes for a capacitive
  touch controller; if one answers, the roll-entry screen adds a tap grid. If
  not, everything behaves exactly as it always has. The buttons work on every
  board either way — touch is additive, never required. See "Touch input"
  below.
- USB-C cable for flashing. **Not required afterward** — see the security
  note about running on battery power for actual use.

## Installing DiceSeed

Every release publishes two firmware files plus `SHA-256SUMS`. Each file
is a **complete image** — bootloader, partition table, and application
together — and installing it is one command, the same whether the board
is brand-new or already running an older DiceSeed:

```sh
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA-256SUMS     # verify before you flash
esptool write-flash 0x0 diceseed-vX.Y.Z-compat.bin
```

(Get `esptool` with `pip install esptool`. On Linux your user needs the
`dialout` group; the USB-C cable must carry data, not charge-only.)

**Which file**: `-compat` is the default build; `-classic` is the
hand-auditable alternative — see [Build variants](#build-variants).
Picking "wrong" is harmless: same hardware either way, reflash the other
one.

**A failed flash is never a dead board.** The ESP32-S3's download mode
lives in silicon — hold **BOOT** while pressing **RST** (or while
plugging in) and the chip accepts a fresh flash over USB no matter what
the flash contains. Interrupted writes are recovered by simply flashing
again.

**Second-hand board, or want a provably clean chip?** Run
`esptool erase-chip` once before your first flash — it wipes all 16MB
to the erased state; regular installs never need it (DiceSeed keeps
secrets in RAM only, so ordinary updates leave nothing behind).

The `SHA-256SUMS` check proves your download is exactly what CI built
from the tagged commit; the stronger form — rebuilding the release
yourself and comparing hashes — is documented in
[Reproducible builds](docs/reproducible-build.md). Where a maintainer has
enabled signed releases, verify the signature first — see
[Signing](docs/signing.md).

## Build variants

One codebase, one repo, two firmware builds — selected by a single flag in
`build_mode.h` (`DICESEED_COMPAT_BUILD`). This exists because a local BTC
group wanted a way to trust this tool anchored to two things they already
trust: [iancoleman.io](https://iancoleman.io/bip39) and
[SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com). Everything except the dice→entropy
step — display, buttons, wipe, wordlist, the BIP39 checksum step — is
identical between the two; that's deliberate, so there's only one thing to
independently review twice, not two whole codebases.

| | **Compat** (default, `DICESEED_COMPAT_BUILD=1`) | **Classic** (`DICESEED_COMPAT_BUILD=0`) |
|---|---|---|
| Roll → entropy | SHA-256 of the literal roll digits (`"1"`-`"6"`, no separator), low N bits of the digest | Whole roll sequence as one base-6 positional number, low N bits taken |
| Hand-auditable | No — SHA-256 isn't hand-computable | Yes — pencil-and-paper, in principle |
| Same rolls on a real **SeedSigner** unit | **Identical mnemonic** (verified against SeedSigner's own published test vectors) | Different mnemonic |
| Verifiable against **iancoleman.io** | Via the on-screen raw-entropy hex (below) — not its Dice mode | Via the on-screen raw-entropy hex (below) — not its Dice mode |

Neither variant is "more correct" — pick based on which property matters
more for a given device. **Compat is the default** because the point of a
group standardizing on this device is cross-checkable output, and that
should be what people get without touching anything; someone who
specifically wants to redo the whole derivation by hand wants **classic**
instead.

To build classic instead of the default:
- Edit `DiceSeed/build_mode.h`, change the `1` to `0`, then compile/upload as usual — or
- `arduino-cli`, without touching tracked source (run from inside `DiceSeed/`):
  `arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:lilygo_t_display_s3 --build-property "build.extra_flags=-DDICESEED_COMPAT_BUILD=0" .`

The menu screen's version string shows which one is actually flashed
(`v2.0.0-classic` / `v2.0.0-compat`) — always check it after flashing,
especially if you're maintaining both builds across multiple boards.

## Building from source

Only needed for development, or to verify releases independently. If you
just want DiceSeed on a board, see [Installing DiceSeed](#installing-diceseed).

- **Reproducibly** (recommended when the result matters):
  `tools/build-firmware.sh` builds both variants in a throwaway Docker
  container from a pinned toolchain, byte-identical to the release
  binaries — see [Reproducible builds](docs/reproducible-build.md).
- **With your own toolchain** (fast development iteration: compile and
  flash in one step): the IDE or `arduino-cli` instructions below. Your
  binaries may differ from the releases as toolchain versions drift —
  fine for development; flash from a release or the Docker build when
  the result matters.

Confirmed working on real hardware as of v1.2.0 (display renders correctly),
v2.0.1 (compat build's entropy matched both SeedSigner and iancoleman.io on
the same rolls; the two-button wipe hold works correctly — a v2.0.0
regression in that gesture was found and fixed in v2.0.1, see the version
history in `DiceSeed.ino`), v2.1.0 (the backup-verification quiz), v2.2.0
(tap-to-enter rolls on a Touch board, and the same binary falling back to
buttons on a non-touch board — both confirmed on real hardware), and v2.3.0
(the word-count menu as tap cells on a Touch board, including BTN2's
refusal to start an unchosen session), and v2.3.1 (BTN2's refusal to
commit an unselected roll — confirmed on the Touch board; the non-touch
white-until-chosen face rendering from the same change is compile-verified
only, no non-touch board was on hand), and v2.3.2 (the both-button
leave-rolling escape hatch and its confirm screen — confirmed on the
Touch board), and v2.3.3 (quiz candidate cells and word-page paging
cells — confirmed on the Touch board via a full 50-roll session), and
v2.4.0 (a back cell on the touch roll screen — confirmed on the Touch
board), and v2.4.1 (repository layout only: the sketch moved into a
`DiceSeed/` subdirectory so "Download ZIP" opens cleanly — no firmware
change, byte-for-byte identical to v2.4.0), and v2.4.2-v2.4.7 (the
roll-grid select/flash color language, the all-words backup quiz with
its summary, and the hex flow screen — confirmed on the Touch board; the
button-edge markers via a forced-non-touch build on the same chassis;
plus the CI/reproducible-build/release pipeline, confirmed by its own
runs).

**Getting the code onto disk:** `git clone
https://github.com/Lexcat25/DiceSeed.git`, or use GitHub's "Download ZIP".
Either way the sketch lives in the `DiceSeed/` subdirectory — open
`DiceSeed/DiceSeed.ino` in the Arduino IDE. Since that folder is named
`DiceSeed`, matching the `.ino`, the IDE opens it directly with every
header (`build_mode.h`, `diceseed_core.h`, `bip39_wordlist.h`,
`tft_setup.h`, `touch.h`) alongside it. (Before v2.4.1 the sketch sat at
the repo root, and a ZIP download — which unpacks to `DiceSeed-<version>/`,
not `DiceSeed/` — triggered a `fatal error: build_mode.h: No such file or
directory` for anyone not using `git clone`. The `DiceSeed/` subdirectory
is the fix.)

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (2.x) or
   [`arduino-cli`](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/).
2. Add the ESP32 board index:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
   (Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs), then install the **esp32**
   platform (tested against 3.3.11).
3. Install the **TFT_eSPI** library (tested against 2.5.43) via Library
   Manager.
4. Board: **LilyGo T-Display-S3** (`esp32:esp32:lilygo_t_display_s3`) — the `esp32:esp32`
   platform ships a dedicated board entry for this exact board (search "T-Display-S3" in
   Boards Manager), which also gets the flash size (16MB) and partition table right. The
   generic "ESP32S3 Dev Module" entry also compiles this sketch, but under different
   flash/partition defaults that don't match what's actually on the board.
5. Open `DiceSeed/DiceSeed.ino` and compile/upload. No other Tools-menu
   settings need changing — the sketch opens no serial port, so the USB CDC
   options don't matter either way.

The same thing with `arduino-cli`, run from inside the `DiceSeed/` sketch
folder (`cd DiceSeed` from the repo root). Prefer a build that matches the
published release binaries byte-for-byte? `tools/build-firmware.sh` builds
both variants reproducibly in Docker from a pinned toolchain — see
[Reproducible builds](docs/reproducible-build.md) (v2.4.7).

```sh
# one-time setup
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
arduino-cli lib install TFT_eSPI

# build (compat is the default; add the --build-property line for classic)
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:lilygo_t_display_s3 .
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:lilygo_t_display_s3 \
  --build-property "build.extra_flags=-DDICESEED_COMPAT_BUILD=0" .

# flash -- find your port first
arduino-cli board list
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:lilygo_t_display_s3 .
```

On Linux your user needs to be in the `dialout` group to open the serial port
(`sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`, then log out and back in).

You do **not** need to hand-edit TFT_eSPI's own `User_Setup_Select.h`. This
repo ships `tft_setup.h` in the sketch folder, which TFT_eSPI auto-detects
and loads on its own (`__has_include(<tft_setup.h>)` — TFT_eSPI's own
documented mechanism, see that file's comments) with the exact ST7789/
8-bit-parallel pin configuration this board actually uses. Without it,
TFT_eSPI's out-of-the-box default targets a completely different display
and pin set (ILI9341 over SPI) — it still **compiles clean**, it just
drives nothing on real hardware, which is why this file matters even
though nothing about it is visible from a successful build log.

## Using it

1. Power on → menu: toggle 12-word (50 rolls) / 24-word (99 rolls) with
   button 1, confirm with button 2. **On a Touch board** the two counts are
   tap cells — tap one to light it, tap the same one again to start (see
   "Touch input" below).
2. For each roll: cycle the face 1–6 with button 1 to match your physical
   die, confirm with button 2. The first button-1 press lights the current
   face (1 after each commit); each further press advances it — so a roll
   of N takes N presses. An unselected press of button 2 is refused with a
   red hint rather than silently recording the default. The face shows
   white until selected, green once chosen. Long-press button 2 to go back
   a roll if you mis-entered one. **On a Touch board** you can instead tap
   the face directly — and tap the `<` cell at the top-left to go back a
   roll — see "Touch input" below. **To abandon a session**,
   hold both buttons for 2 seconds on the roll screen: a confirm screen
   offers Cancel (every entered roll kept) or Wipe & return to the menu
   (RAM scrubbed, device reboots).
 3. After the last roll, the mnemonic is shown, four words per screen
    (button 2: next page; **on a Touch board** the `<`/`>` cells at the
    right edge page back and forward — `<` is ignored on page 1, and `>`
    on the last page opens the **raw-entropy hex screen** below). A red
    warning appears if
    every single roll came
    back identical — a sanity check, not a hard stop.
 4. Next comes the **backup quiz that checks every word** — all 12 or all
    24, one at a time (through v2.4.3
    it spot-checked 3 checkpoint words; v2.4.4 removed the blind spots).
    **On a Touch board** the quiz starts from the hex screen: `>` (or
    button 2) there begins verification, `<` goes back to the words; on
    button boards button 2 on the last word page enters the quiz
    directly.
    Each check presents the 3 candidates (the real word plus 2 decoys) —
    one at a time on button
    boards, or as three tap cells on a Touch board (tap one to light it,
    tap it again to lock in); cycle with button 1, lock in your pick with
    button 2, and it tells you right/wrong; button 2 — or, on a Touch
    board, any tap — moves to the
    next word. This is a genuine blind pick, not a "here's the answer,
    compare it yourself" re-display — it's meant to catch "I misread the
    word the first time and wrote down the wrong one confidently," not
    just "did I copy it correctly," which is the more common and more
    serious way a written-down backup actually goes wrong. After the last
    word a summary screen reports **"All 12/24 words verified. Your
    backup matches this seed."** — or lists every word number that did
    not match, so you can correct exactly those against the word list —
    then returns to page 1.
 5. **Button 1** on the result screen (word pages, or between quiz
    checkpoints once you've locked in an answer)
    toggles to a **raw entropy (hex)** view —
    the intermediate bytes your rolls produced, before the BIP39 checksum
    and word lookup. **On a Touch board** (v2.4.5) the hex view instead
    sits in the flow — `>` on the last word page shows it before the quiz
    — and button 1 mirrors the `<` cell (back a page) rather than
    toggling it.
    Paste that hex into any BIP39 tool's raw entropy field
   (iancoleman.io: the **Hex [0-9A-F]** option, not its Dice mode — see
   [Cross-checking your output](#cross-checking-your-output)) to
   independently confirm the mnemonic, regardless of which build produced
   it. It's exactly as sensitive as the mnemonic itself — treat viewing it
   with the same care.
6. **Hold both buttons for 2 seconds** to wipe RAM and reset back to the
   menu. This is the only way to leave the result screen; there's no
   "start a new one without wiping" shortcut, deliberately.

## Touch input

On a **T-Display S3 Touch** board the word-count menu, the roll-entry
screen, the leave-rolling confirm screen, and the result screen are
touch-operable: the 12/24 counts, the six dice faces, the roll screen's
`<` back cell, the cancel/wipe cells, the word-page `<`/`>` paging cells,
the hex screen's `<`/`>` cells (v2.4.5), and the quiz's candidate words
draw as tap cells (the back and paging
cells are single-tap — instantly reversible; everything that commits a
choice keeps the two-tap rule).
Nothing requires touch, and the buttons work identically on every screen
either way. Touch is additive, never required.

- On the menu, the same rule one level up: **tap a word count to light it,
  tap the same count again to start**. No cell starts pre-lit, and until a
  count is chosen BTN2 refuses to start (red hint) instead of committing
  an invisible default.
- **First tap selects** a face and outlines its cell in bold white (a
  double white border). **A second tap on that same cell commits** the
  roll — the cell flashes green for a beat as it locks in, then the screen
  advances. It is deliberately not commit-on-first-tap: a
  mis-tap would otherwise write a wrong roll with no warning, and on this
  device a wrong roll is a wrong seed.
- Until you choose, every cell is plain (grey border, white digit). The
  white-outlined cell always means "another tap here commits this"; green
  on this screen is only ever the momentary confirm flash. After a commit
  the grid returns to all-plain rather than pre-selecting a value you did
  not pick.
- **The buttons still work**, and work identically, including on a Touch
  board — cycling with button 1 lights the matching cell. Mix the two freely.
- Taps landing in the gaps between cells are ignored rather than snapped to the
  nearest one.
- **The two-button hold *gesture* stays button-only.** It is meant to be
  hard to trigger by accident, which a touch gesture would undermine. On
  the roll screen it opens a confirm screen whose *choices* are tappable
  (the hard-to-trigger interlock has already fired); on the result screen
  it remains an immediate wipe with no touch involvement.

### Hardware notes

Everything here was verified on both board variants before it was written, and
is documented at length in `touch.h`:

- The controller is a **CST816-family part at I2C address 0x15**. LilyGO also
  ships boards with a **CST328 at 0x1A**, which this does *not* drive — such a
  board reports "no touch" and falls back to the buttons. That is the correct
  degradation, not a failure. LilyGO's own example cannot tell the two apart
  either; it asks you to try one and switch if touch misbehaves.
- Presence **must** be probed with a bare address ACK. The chip sits in standby
  until a touch event and will not answer a register read before then, so
  reading its ID register at boot reports "absent" on a perfectly good panel.
- The chip **auto-sleeps after 2 seconds** of no touch (register 0xF9, factory
  default) and stops answering while asleep. Register 0xFE disables that; the
  write is retried on the first read the chip does answer, since at boot it may
  already be asleep and reject the write itself.
- Coordinates arrive in the panel's native 170×320 portrait frame, so they need
  rotating for the landscape UI: `display_x = native_y`,
  `display_y = 169 - native_x`.
- The driver is hand-rolled rather than pulling in TouchLib. Once the probe is
  an address ACK and a read is 7 bytes from register 0x00, a large dependency
  buys nothing and widens what an auditor has to read.

## Security model

- No WiFi or Bluetooth code anywhere in this repo — the ESP32 core never
  brings either radio up.
- Rolls and the mnemonic live only in RAM. Nothing is ever written to
  flash, NVS, or Serial (`Serial.begin()` is never called).
- Sensitive buffers are cleared with `mbedtls_platform_zeroize()` (not
  `memset`, which a compiler can optimize away as a dead store) at boot and
  before the wipe-triggered reset. This now includes the raw entropy buffer
  (kept in RAM for the hex display above), not just the rolls and mnemonic.
- Entropy comes **only** from the dice rolls you enter — enforced since
  v2.3.1, not just stated: an unselected roll cannot be committed (BTN2
  is refused until a face was deliberately chosen), so a default value
  the user never picked cannot enter the rolls. The one place this
  device's hardware RNG (`esp_random()`) is used at all is picking which
  *wrong* words to show as decoys in the backup-verification quiz below —
  that has no bearing on the mnemonic itself and isn't part of the entropy
  path in any sense; it's confirmed to have no side effects on other
  subsystems either (unlike `WiFi.mode()`, see the wordier history in
  `DiceSeed.ino`).
- The **compat** build's use of SHA-256 for the entropy step isn't a new
  trust dependency: the BIP39 checksum step requires SHA-256 in *every*
  build, classic included, so compat just reuses that exact same
  already-required `mbedtls` call for a second purpose.

**What this cannot protect against:** the T-Display S3's USB port is a
native USB-Serial-JTAG peripheral, enabled by default at the silicon
level. Anyone with a USB cable and OpenOCD can halt the CPU and dump RAM
while a phrase is on screen, regardless of anything the firmware does. Run
it on battery power with no USB cable attached whenever you're actually
entering rolls or reading back a phrase.

**Known, accepted limitation (classic build only):** the 12-word/50-roll
mode has a small modular bias (effective min-entropy ≈127.4 bits, not a
clean 128) because
`6^50` needs slightly more than 128 bits and gets folded down via `mod
2^128`. This is the same tradeoff the reference
[iancoleman.io dice method](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) makes — a
bias-free fix needs rejection sampling (occasionally asking for one more
roll), which was deliberately left out because it would break "verify this
by hand with pencil and paper." The 24-word/99-roll mode has **no** such
bias — 99 rolls was chosen specifically because `6^99 - 1 < 2^256`, so the
full number fits with nothing discarded. See `diceseed_core.h` for the
exact math.

## Testing

The dice→entropy→BIP39 algorithm lives in `diceseed_core.h`, deliberately
separated from anything Arduino/TFT-specific so it can be compiled and run
on a desktop. `tests/run_tests.sh` builds and runs `tests/test_core.cpp` in
a throwaway Docker container (no toolchain install needed on your machine)
against:

- the official [trezor/python-mnemonic](https://github.com/trezor/python-mnemonic)
  BIP39 test vectors (entropy → mnemonic, published independently of this
  repo), and
- dice-roll → entropy/mnemonic vectors computed by an independent Python
  re-implementation, itself validated against the same official vectors
  before being trusted to generate them.

```
tests/run_tests.sh
```

The **compat** build is additionally checked against SeedSigner's own
published [dice test vectors](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/blob/main/docs/dice_verification.md) —
not retyped by hand, verified byte-for-byte via an independent Python
computation before being trusted, same standard as every other vector set
in this repo.

Run `tests/run_tests.sh` after touching `diceseed_core.h`, `bip39_wordlist.h`,
or `tests/vectors.h`.

### CI

`.github/workflows/build.yml` (v2.4.6) runs that same test suite and
builds **both firmware variants** on every push and PR — via
`tools/build-firmware.sh` (v2.4.7), the same pinned, Docker-based,
**reproducible** path a local build uses (`arduino-cli` 1.5.1,
`esp32:esp32` 3.3.11, `TFT_eSPI` 2.5.43 — the versions above, documented
as tested, so a green checkmark certifies a build of what's described,
not of whatever the package index shipped that morning). Every run
uploads both `.bin`s + their `SHA-256SUMS` as an artifact. No flashing,
no hardware in CI — anything touching a real board stays manual, as
always. See [Reproducible builds](docs/reproducible-build.md) for
verifying a released binary against the source.

### Releases

Releases are **automated** (v2.4.7): merging to `main` a commit that
bumps `FIRMWARE_VERSION_BASE` past the latest `v*` tag — with its
matching `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` present — makes CI tag the merged
commit, build both variants reproducibly, create the GitHub Release with
the notes file as its body, and attach both `.bin`s + `SHA-256SUMS`. The
whole human process is: *write the notes, bump the version, merge*. A
bump without its notes file fails the job loudly — no notes, no release.
A `workflow_dispatch` dry run rehearses the detection on any branch with
no side effects.

## Cross-checking your output

**Don't type your raw dice rolls into iancoleman.io's "Dice" mode expecting
a match — on either build, that's not how to verify this device, and a
mismatch there doesn't mean anything is wrong.** BIP39 only standardizes
entropy→mnemonic; it says nothing about how dice rolls become entropy, and
iancoleman's Dice mode uses yet another convention (a variable-length
prefix code, face `6`→digit `0`) that doesn't match either DiceSeed build.
Confirmed directly: an all-`1`s roll sequence gives three *different*
results across DiceSeed-classic, DiceSeed-compat, and iancoleman's Dice
mode — none of them wrong, just three independently-invented conventions
for a step BIP39 never standardized.

**The actual verification paths, both using the on-device raw-entropy hex
screen** (see [Using it](#using-it), step 4):

- **Against iancoleman.io (either build):** roll, then view the raw entropy
  hex on-device, then paste that hex — not the rolls — into iancoleman's
  **Hex [0-9A-F]** entropy field (not Dice). That field does plain
  entropy→mnemonic, which is standard BIP39 and matches on both builds. Do
  this with a downloaded, offline copy of the page, and only with a test
  roll sequence you don't intend to actually use, never a real phrase.
- **Against SeedSigner (compat build only):** enter the *same physical
  rolls* directly into a real SeedSigner unit's dice-entropy feature. No
  hex transcription needed — compat's entropy derivation matches
  SeedSigner's exactly, so the resulting mnemonic should be identical.
  This is the strongest check available: two independently-developed,
  separately-audited implementations agreeing from the same raw input.

## Roadmap

Planned hardening and UX work — reproducible builds with published binary
hashes, and signed releases — is tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md),
along with one open design question (whether the compat/classic build mode
should become a runtime menu choice instead of a compile-time flag) that is
deliberately undecided.
